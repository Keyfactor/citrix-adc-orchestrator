## Overview

The Citrix Netscaler Universal Orchestrator extension remotely manages certificates on Citrix Netscaler devices. Citrix Netscaler supports services including Load Balancing, Authentication/Authorization/Auditing (AAA), and Gateways, enabling binding to any of these virtual servers using unique virtual server names for each service.

Certificates are essential for securing communications and establishing trust within Citrix Netscaler. They ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data transmitted between clients and servers.

Defined Certificate Stores within the context of this orchestrator represent locations on the Citrix Netscaler device where certificates are stored, such as file paths or configurations tied to virtual servers. These Certificate Stores facilitate the management tasks, including inventory, addition, and removal of certificates, enhancing the security and manageability of the Citrix Netscaler environment.
